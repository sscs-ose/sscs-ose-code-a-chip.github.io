# Process Design Kits

Process Design Kits, or PDKs, are files provided by a foundry that enables chips
to be implemented for a specific foundry process.

LibreLane supports multiple process design kits, so long that an LibreLane PDK
configuration file is made to support them.

## Specifying your PDK

There are multiple ways to specify a PDK from the command-line interface,
ordered by priority (from highest to lowest):

* Within the `config.json` file: Recommended only for designs that are compatible
  with exactly one PDK.
* The `--pdk` command-line flag
* The `PDK` environment variable
* The default PDK, i.e., the
  [Skywater/Google 130nm PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk).

## Standard Cell Libraries

Standard cells are small silicon patterns that are used to implement basic
functionality throughout your design that have already been designed and
analyzed for timing and other physical information. For example, the standard
cell `sky130_fd_sc_hd__and1` implements a logical AND.

Each PDK comes bundled with collections of standard cells known as "standard
cell libraries" or SCLs for short, some of which are foundry-provided and some
of which are third-party. Each LibreLane PDK configuration specifies a default
standard cell library, so you don't have to worry about picking one- but if you
want to anyway, ordered by priority (from highest to lowest):

* Within the `config.json` file
* The `--scl` command-line flag
* The `STD_CELL_LIBRARY` environment variable
* The default SCL as dictated by the LibreLane PDK configuration files.
  * For sky130, that's `sky130_fd_sc_hd`.

## Building, location and downloading

Most open-source PDKs are not usable in their default formats. This is the
reason we rely on Open PDKs to build the PDK, which will not only place it in a
LibreLane-friendly layout but also generate views of the PDK that are usable by
the aforementioned tools.

Because of extended build times,
the [Google/Skywater 130nm PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk) and the
[Google/GlobalFoundries 180nm PDK](https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk),
are built and cached using [Ciel](https://github.com/fossi-foundation/ciel),
a version manager by the LibreLane team built on top of Open PDKs.

There are multiple variants of each PDK (reflecting different metal stack
configurations):

* `sky130`
  * `sky130A`: The default. 5 metal layers and a local interconnect.
  * `sky130B`: Similar to `sky130A`, but also includes a Resistive RAM (ReRAM)
    layer between `metal1` and `metal2`. See
    [here](https://sky130-fd-pr-reram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/background.html)
    for more information. This affects timing as, for example, `via1` between
    `metal1` and `metal2` is twice as tall.

Both variants are supported by LibreLane, though sky130A has better-calibrated
timing extraction.

```{tip}
The variants are identical on the
[front end of line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_of_line) (FEOL), but
have different
[back end of line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_end_of_line) (BEOL)
processes, one for `A` and one for `B`.

Efabless-run shuttles (including chipIgnite and Google MPW) were "split-lot",
i.e., two identical wafers come out of FEOL are then subjected to different BEOL
processes. Designs targeting a specific variant are packaged only from the
appropriate wafer, with its "twin" on the other wafer, which has timing issues
at best and is a dead chip at worst, is discarded.

This meant you could use either variant on any Efabless `sky130` shuttle
(but not within the same design.) For advice on which variant you should use
today, please consult with your shuttle provider.
```

* `gf180mcu`
  * ~~`gf180mcuA`: 3 metal layers.~~
  * ~~`gf180mcuB`: 4 metal layers.~~
  * ~~`gf180mcuC`: 5 metal layers.~~
  * `gf180mcuD`: The default. 5 metal layers, with a slightly thicker top metal
    layer. The thinner top metal layer has issues with delamination on the pads
    according to GlobalFoundries.

[GFMPW0](https://platform.efabless.com/shuttles/GFMPW-0) was run on `C`,
but any and all future shuttles based on the Google/GlobalFoundries 180nm
process will require `gf180mcuD` as per GlobalFoundry's recommendation. `A`
and `B` were never used and are not supported by LibreLane.

LibreLane is tested with a specific revision of Open PDKs. By default, LibreLane
will attempt to download a build done with that revision using Ciel to the
**PDK root**.

## The PDK Root

The PDK root is a directory containing all of your open-source PDKs. LibreLane
is configured to use the PDK root at the following options (from highest to
lowest priority)"

* The `--pdk-root` command-line flag
* The `PDK_ROOT` environment variable
* A folder named `.ciel` in your home directory.

The PDK root stores downloaded versions of the PDK as well as the Ciel metadata
information.

Each PDK family, e.g., `sky130` or `gf180mcu`, has one active version at a time.
Versions of the PDKs are exactly equal to the `open_pdks` revision they were
built with.

### Using non-Ciel PDKs

```{note}
It is highly recommended to use LibreLane 3.0 from the `dev` branch if you're
porting new PDKs for use with LibreLane.

LibreLane 2.4, the current version as of the time of writing, makes a number
of assumptions favoring the Open PDKs distributed using Ciel.
```

If you want to use PDKs without Ciel (built manually), you will need to pass
this flag:

`--manual-pdk`

This will bypassing checking and attempting to download the PDK using Ciel, so
you can add custom PDKs to the PDK root.

The PDKs must provide the following:

* An LibreLane PDK configuration file at the path
  `{pdk_root}/{pdk}/libs.tech/librelane/config.tcl`.

This Tcl-based (sorry) config file must include values for all non-optional
variables in the {ref}`univ_flow_cvars_pdk`.

* An standard cell library configuration file at the path
  `{pdk_root}/{pdk}/libs.tech/librelane/{scl}/config.tcl`.

This Tcl-based config file must include values for all non-optional variables in
the {ref}`univ_flow_cvars_scl`.

The PDK must also include any step-specific PDK variables for the `Classic` flow
to be compatible with the `Classic` flow.

…the most prudent approach at the moment would be to replicate the configuration
files in the IHP Open PDK and modify them to fit your own platform:
