        "### 1.1 Background\n",
        "\n",
        "According to Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling, continuous transistor miniaturization since 1974 has enabled exponential growth in device density—doubling with each generation—while maintaining higher clock speeds under constant power density. However, around 2007, the benefits of Dennard scaling began to fade due to leakage currents and power density constraints, and by 2012, scaling had largely halted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern computing systems now face severe power and thermal bottlenecks. As transistor density continues to rise, heat dissipation has become a fundamental limitation: chips can no longer operate all transistors simultaneously without exceeding safe thermal limits. This results in “dark silicon,” where only a portion of the available cores can remain active to avoid overheating. Elevated temperatures also degrade device reliability, accelerating wear-out mechanisms and shortening system lifetime.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address these challenges, approximate computing has emerged as a promising solution. By relaxing accuracy requirements in error-tolerant applications, approximate designs can substantially reduce power consumption and heat generation while maintaining acceptable output quality. This paradigm is especially suitable for neural network and large language model (LLM) accelerators, which are inherently resilient to small arithmetic errors. Minor inaccuracies in multiplications or accumulations typically have negligible impact on model accuracy, allowing designers to adopt approximate multipliers, adders, or reduced-precision datapaths for significant savings in power, area, and latency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, fine-tuning techniques can further mitigate hardware-induced errors. By retraining or adapting model parameters on the approximate hardware, most of the lost accuracy can be recovered while retaining energy efficiency gains. This makes approximate computing particularly attractive for large-scale AI accelerators, where computational and memory demands are exceptionally high.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite its promise, approximate computing still faces practical challenges in logic synthesis. Traditional design methods—such as manual simplification or heuristic gate pruning often rely on structural assumptions and struggle to scale for complex arithmetic blocks like multipliers. These methods typically yield locally optimized solutions and lack the flexibility to explore the vast combinational design space.\n",
        "\n",
        "To overcome these limitations, genetic algorithms (GAs) offer an effective alternative. By evolving populations of candidate circuits through mutation, crossover, and selection, GAs can efficiently explore discrete, non-linear design spaces without requiring gradient information or explicit models. Their ability to support multi-objective optimization makes them ideal for balancing trade-offs among accuracy, power, area, and delay.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, most GA-based approximate synthesis approaches remain limited to small-scale demonstrations and rarely connect circuit-level optimization to system-level evaluation. This work bridges that gap by introducing an end-to-end GA-driven framework that synthesizes approximate computing circuits and evaluates their real-world impact on neural network tasks such as image classifications\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 Notebook Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook presents a genetic-algorithm–based framework for approximate logic synthesis and its application-level evaluation on deep learning models including Fashion-MNIST (LeNet-5) and CIFAR-100 (ResNet-18/ResNet-20).\n",
        "The framework supports both random circuit generation and optimization from a seed netlist, providing a complete flow from synthesis to performance analysis.\n",

        "\n",
        "The evolved approximate design is analyzed in OpenSTA to extract power, timing, and LUT information.\n",
        "\n",
