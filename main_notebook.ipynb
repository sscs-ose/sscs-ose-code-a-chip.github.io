        "Micropattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) are highly precise devices used for particle detection in high-energy physics experiments. One notable application is in ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), one of the four big experiments at the CERN's (European Organization for Nuclear Research) Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The experiment investigates the physics of strongly interacting matter, known as quark-gluon plasma, formed in lead-ion collisions [1].\n",
        "\n",
        "In this context, the SAMPA chip was developed, a 32-channel ASIC, designed in order  to upgrade the readout front-end electronics of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and Muon Chamber (MCH) after the LHC second long shutdown. The chip is responsible for signal amplification, digital conversion, processing, compression and filtering of the signals from the detectors [2].\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the [SALSA](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1327482/contributions/5692916/) chip project - being developed in a collaboration of the University of São Paulo (USP) and the Institute of Research into the Fundamental Laws of the Universe (IRFU) - aims to be a new versatile readout chip for MPGDs of the future experiments of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) project, which will be installed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the USA in early 2030 [3].\n",

        "This new chip is an ASIC designed to read, amplify and\n",
        "convert analog signals captured by the detectors, utilizing an\n",
        "ADC [4]. It also accommodates a wider range of signal amplitudes and electrode capacitance, while proposing a larger range of peaking time and optimized data processing in comparison with SAMPA. Its architecture incorporates digital signal filters to mitigate noise interference, ensuring high accuracy in particle collision data. While the current filtering process employs FIR, IIR and slope based filters, a new method based on median filtering which incorporates the implementation of a common-mode noise (CMN) subtraction method is being tested.\n",
        "\n",
        "The common mode noise (CMN) subtraction is a non-linear digital filter that aims to reduce the coherent noise affecting all channels. This includes the evaluation of the coherent noise and subtraction from each channel’s sample [5]. This evaluation involves calculating the median of the signals from the 64 channels in real time to be used for reducing noise interference and getting better precision in the data acquisition. For the calculation of the channels' median, three different approaches are considered, each employing distinct algorithms to achieve efficient and accurate results:\n",

        "\n",
        "##2.1) Bitonic sorting\n",
        "Bitonic sort is a highly parallel sorting algorithm based on the concept of a bitonic sequence. In other words, a sequence of numbers that first monotonically increases and then monotonically decreases, or vice versa. This method was chosen as the basis for comparison with the other two newly made algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sorting process consists of two main steps. First, the unsorted list is recursively divided into smaller sub-sequences, halving the list each time until the smallest units, consisting of 2 elements, are formed. Each small sub-sequence is transformed into a bitonic sequence, where one portion is sorted in ascending order and the other in descending order. In each subsequent stage, the number of elements in the sequences doubles until the full list of 64 values is reached. Then, by comparing and swapping pairs of elements, these bitonic sequences are merged and sorted, moving the largest elements to the lower half and the lowest to the upper half, ensuring the final sequence is in the correct order [6].\n",
        "\n",
        "In a hardware implementation, two types of comparators are used: the ascending order comparator(AO Comparator) and the descending order comparator (DO Comparator). Each comparator takes two input values and two sorted outputs values according to its respective order. These comparators enable the transformation into smaller bitonic sequences. By recursively doubling the size of the sequence at each stage, the algorithm sorts the full set of 64 data values in ascending order. Once sorted, the median is found as the 33rd element (As the SALSA chip has 64 channels, the median value is considered to be the 33rd greatest value for simplification).\n",

        "##2.2) Bit-wise Median Finder (BWMF) algorithm\n",
        "The bit-wise median finder is a new algorithm developed by the SALSA team that utilizes a pipeline implementation to efficiently compute the median by processing the 12-bit input data across multiple stages. Running from the MSB to the LSB of each 12-bit input data register, one bit at each stage iteration, the algorithm uses the calculation of partial median values, estimated by the majority quantity of numbers 1’s and 0’s in a determined bit position. By comparing the partial median value with the actual data bit of each channel, it is possible to refine the candidate values for the final median.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once this partial median is established for the current iteration, the algorithm compares it with the actual bit in the 12-bit register. If it does not match with the majority bit (partial median), that data bit register is marked as a non candidate for the final median in subsequent stages and it is all replaced with 1’s or 0’s depending on the registered median value for that stage. Conversely, if the bit matches the partial median, that value remains a potential candidate for the final result and stays in the collection of values for further recursive comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process repeats iteratively across all bit positions, progressively refining the set of candidate values and storing the partial medians in a 12-bit register. By the end of the pipeline, the full median is registered for an output.\n",

        "##2.3) Combinatorial Sum Median Finder (CSMF) algorithm\n",
        "The combinatorial sum median finder is a hardware implemented algorithm developed by the authors that aims to find the median value from a collection of data in a highly parallelized manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "The method utilized here to find the median value is based on the fact the median value (here assumed as the 33rd greatest value of the data collection) is bigger than 32 other values. Therefore, by comparing every two channels in a\n",
        "combinatorial manner resulting in 2016 comparisons (C<sub>64,2</sub> ), we can calculate for each channel value how many channels have smaller samples. With that, there should be a channel that has 0 samples smaller than it all the way to a channel that has 63 samples smaller than it. So the channel whose number of smaller samples is 32 should be the 33rd greatest number, in other words, the wanted median.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the hardware implementation in mind, each channel has two individual components: a Hamming weight component (counts the number of ones in its input) and a comparator that compares the output of the 1’s counter with 32. Furthermore there are 2016 comparators, one for every combination of two channels (channel X and Y). This comparator has two outputs one for X ≥ Y and other for X < Y . The first output goes to the 1’s counter of the channel X and the other goes to the 1’s counter of the Y channel. With that circuitry, the\n",
        "1’s counter of each channel counts the number of channels with smaller samples, that number goes to comparator of that channel, and if it is equal to 32, this channel is the one that contains the median value and therefore should be the\n",
        "output. As the three aforementioned componentes are implemented in combinational logic, this design manages to find the median value in one clock cycle.\n",

        "##2.4) Tests and results\n",
        "To evaluate the efficiency, accuracy and practicality of the three proposed algorithms (Bitonic Sort, MWMF and CSMF), a series of tests for power, area and number of flip-flops needed for their hardware implementation were conducted by the team.\n",
        "\n",
        "The criterias of the comparison are: the smaller the area, the better, as the cost of implementation in an ASIC is proportional to the area and SALSA will be a big design. Concerning the power, it is desired to have an economic design. In addition, due to the operation in a highly radioactive environment the number of flip-flops is important, because the higher the number of that digital component, the greater the chances of a bit-flip occurring, in other words, it becomes less error tolerant. Also, if the number of FFs is smaller, it is easier to implement a triple modular redundancy (TMR) as it was used in SAMPA [7], this technique triplicates the number of storage components as a countermeasure to the bit-flip events. And lastly, it is good to have a small number of cycles so that the pipeline, designed to wait for the median to be found, takes less area and power.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first approach, the sorting method using the bitonic algorithm was the most power hungry of them, while also being the intermediate option in terms of area, number of cycles and number of flip-flops. Its high power consumption\n",
        "can discourage utilization in power constrained applications and also thermally sensitive environments as it generates more heat due to continuous operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The BWMF algorithm proved to be a good option if the throughput is not the primary concern, since it has a small area and power consumption. However the big number of FFs requires a larger pipeline, which drains more power, occupy\n",
        "more area and increases the filter’s latency. Additionally, this high flip-flop count would make this approach more susceptible to radiation events and also harder to implement with TMR, as triplicating all flip-flops would significantly\n",
        "increase the area. Therefore, this approach is suitable to lowpower applications, but less suitable for fast response times due to its high latency and may not be optimal for highly radioactive environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the CSMF algorithm is the best option when considering throughput, as it has the smallest number of cycles and its competitors cannot reach the same performance. Its area is considerably larger than the others, but the small number of flip-flops can compensate if TMR is implemented (the triplication of a small number of FFs generate a small increase in area) and also the smaller number of cycles helps reduce the overall area as the pipeline required for its\n",
        "implementation is smaller. Thus this design is well suited to highly radioactive environments considering its low flip-flop count, which simplifies the TMR implementation whilst maintaining acceptable dimensions and power consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the CSMF algorithm turned to be a promising approach for implementing a median filter in the context of high-energy physics experiments. Its balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and moderate resource usage makes it particularly well-suited to the demanding real-time data processing requirements of this field.\n",
        "\n",
        "To validate this algorithm, the authors proposed a smaller chip with only 8 channels, each with 8 bits to test the proposed CSMF algorith. This chip endend up being called MARTIn (Median Algorithm Reduced Test Interface).\n",

        "#3. MARTIn chip\n",
        "\n",
        "The MARTIn is a simplified chip which contains the implementation of the CSMF algorithm, while also encompassing a LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift-Register), that works as a pseudo random number generator, for testing maximum clock speeds, and a shift register for radiation tolerance testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MARTIn chip was implemented using the IHP 130nm [BiCMOS Open Source PDK](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK) due to the possibility of costless fabrication according to [IHP Open Design Lib](https://ihp-open-ip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

        "\n",
        "This project was made aiming for designing a filter module to be implemented in the SALSA chip. The task of developing this part generated three approaches, with two of them having new median finding algorithms developed by our team.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of those algorithms was innovative and promising (CSMF), so a reduced version was proposed to be created and tested. For ease of production and testing, the open source environment was choosen with the IHP SG13G2 Open Source PDK.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chip, called MARTIn was coded, synthesized, got its layout done and was tested utilizing only open source tools. The design was accepted in the IHP November 2024 round for production and is now under production.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to that the team explored a new educational tool: Python for generating animations to explain digital circuits. So utilizing the Manim package, an animation that explains the innovative median finding algorithm was made.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore this project developed a functional coherent noise removal filter with a innovative algorithm for median finding and a reduced version is under production using open source PDK. With these results in hand, it is possible to show that contributions to the world of particle physics experiments, mainly in the field of microelectronics, can be done utilizing free open source tools that are avaliable to any school, university and person.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next steps for this project are testing the physical chip to ensure this design works and also evaluate its radiation tolerance, which is an important factor in the field of particle physics experiments.\n",
