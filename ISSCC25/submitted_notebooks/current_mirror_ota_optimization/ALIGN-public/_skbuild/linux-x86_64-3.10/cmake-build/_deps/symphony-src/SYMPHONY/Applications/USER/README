*               DEVELOPING A CUSTOMIZED SOLVER USING CALLBACKS               * 
******************************************************************************

To use SYMPHONY's callbacks to develop a customized solver, fill in the stub
functions provided in the files in this directory, as described in the user's
manual. Follow the instructions below to compile your application.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

Full documentation comes with your distribution in the directory SYMPHONY/Doc
and can also be downloaded at ftp://branchandcut.org/pub/reference/. There is
a user's guide (latest version is SYMPHONY-5.1-Manual.pdf) that should be read
prior to developing an application.

*                              INSTALLATION                                  *
******************************************************************************

Please see the INSTALL file for a guide to compile SYMPHONY USER application.

*                           SAMPLE APPLICATIONS                               *
*******************************************************************************

There are a number of sample applications available as examples of how to
do development with SYMPHONY. These include solvers for the matching problem,
the set partitioning problem (simple and advanced versions), the vehicle
routing and traveling salesman problems, and the mixed postman problem. These
applications are distributed as separate packages and can be downloaded from
www.branchandcut.org. There is a white paper that guides the user through the
development of the matching solver.

AUTHORS

SYMPHONY was jointly developed by Ted Ralphs (ted@lehigh.edu) and Laci
Ladanyi (ladanyi@us.ibm.com). Menal Guzelsoy (megb@lehigh.edu) helped with
development, documentation, and debugging of SYMPHONY 4.0 and 5.0.
