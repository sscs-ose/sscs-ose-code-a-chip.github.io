    "The LC-VCO, as stated in the name, relies on a LC tank circuit that resonates at a target center frequency. The parallel inductor and capacitor will resonate at a frequency dependent on their values, but they also have parasitic resistances associated with them. This resistance, most prominent in the inductor, causes any produced tones to quickly diminish, defeating the purpose of the oscillator. In order to counteract this effect, we can include a second resistor in parallel with the RLC tank that creates an equivalent negative resistance to the parasitics faced. To realize this \"negative resistance\", we can use a cross-coupled pair (XCP) circuit, which creates a negative transconductance looking into the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Parameters\n",
    "The target frequency for this VCO is 2.4GHz. This frequency was decided upon because of its extensive usage between IoT, BLE, WiFi, and more. In future revisions, 20GHz and 40GHz implentations will also be explored. Equation (1) describes the ideal relationship between the LC tank values and it's resonant frequency. \n",
    "$$\\omega=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}} \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "For this oscillator, an inductance value of 2nH was chosen, primarily for it's size and potential for a high Q-factor. Using the above equation, an ideal capacitance of around 2.2pF is derived. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Inductor Derivation\n",
    "ASITIC was used to realize the planar inductors needed to create the LC tank. ASITIC provides an excellent tool for optimizing inductor layouts based off of Q-factor and inductance for given size parameters. Because ASITIC does not natively support DRC rules, square inductors are used to keep it DRC clean for SKY130. The 2nH inductor was derived in ASITIC using the following:\n",

    "```\n",
    "L = 1.999 nH, R = 2.9...\n",
    "Found: n=3, w=24, s=2, L=1.999, Q=9.8\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can then export the CIF file (layout), which KLayout can import and convert to GDS.\n",
    "```\n",
    "cif ../exports/2nhInductor.cif 2nhInductor\n",
    "```\n",
    "Extracting a pi-equivalent circuit model of the inductor is the next step. This is an instrumental part of the process; the parasitic series resistance within the inductor will play a large role in the creation of the VCO core later on. There are 2 ways this can accomplished in ASITIC; `pi` will calculate the equivalent circuit, whereas `pi2` will attempt to extract it using EM analysis. Because both return theoretical results that are only accurate to some degree, an average of the two should be sufficient for most approximations. Once you have extracted the series resistance of the inductor, you can use equation (2) to calculate the equivalent parallel resistance:\n",
    "$$R_{P}=\\frac{(\\omega_{o}L)^{2}}{R_{S}}=Q_{L}^{2}R_{S} \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Varactor Calculations\n",
    "To implement the tuning functionality of this LC-VCO, varactors are used in place of a conventional capacitor in the LC tank circuit. This provides a way to adjust the reactance of the capacitors with a tuning voltage, which will consequently alter the resonant frequency of the tank circuit. However, conceiving accurate simulations with the current SKY130 varactor models has proven difficult because of their non-continuous nature. To overcome this, the measurement data provided by CoolCAD of a few varactor test structures were used. \n",
    "\n",
    "fig of varactor graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The measured behavior of m56 parallel 5x10 micron varactors has been graphed above. This data [2] can be used to roughly approximate the behavior of a the 5x10 varactor, which can be used to build a varactor large enough for the LC tank. \n",
    "\n",
    "## MOSFET Characterization\n",
    "Now that we have an idea of what the parallel resistance faced in the tank circuit is, we can create a cross-coupled pair to counteract it. However, we first need to characterize the SKY130 FETs to get a better idea of how to size the VCO core. \n",
    "\n",
    "## VCO Core Design\n",
    "With the theoretical behavior of the PDK FET devices now understood, along with the required negative resistance, an adequate cross-coupled pair can be constructed. To understand how this design will be derived, let us first examine how exactly a XCP works. \n",
