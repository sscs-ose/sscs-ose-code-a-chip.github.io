        "This notebook demonstrates an ad-hoc retiming engine that takes advantage of arithmetic modules with dynamic pipelines stages to alleviate timing closure on an L2 normilization filter. Our demonstration uses open-source tools and PDKs. We open-source both our decision making algorithm for retiming, as well as the library with the pipelined modules. Vector norms, like L2, are fundamental and effective tools for measuring, comparing, and manipulating data with precision and are usefull among other domains, in machine learning (ML). Our arithmetic module library aims to contribute to the open-source hardware design community to enable more efficient ML applications. Moreover, our open-source custom retiming algorithm can serve as a reference point for understanding the principles that govern the process of retiming in digital design. This submission is completed by members of SiliconJackets. We are a student run organization at Georgia Tech that introduces students to semiconductor design, verification, and implementation through a large collaborative project. We are hoping to use this notebook as an example for future members of the club.\n",
