    "Power management is an unavoidable concern in application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) design projects. The importance of power considerations gets even more critical when we consider future edge devices for the Internet of Things (IoT), such as an energy-autonomous node with energy harvesting capabilities and analog, mixed signal and digital on-chip function blocks.\n",
    "The most challenging part of the power management system are the blocks downstream towards the function blocks, namely the DC-DC converters and the LDOs (Fig. 1). In previous works, this problem has been considered by eliminating the LDO and replacing it by an active filter [1] or by considering different DC-DC-LDO on-chip or off-chip configurations, depending on the operation requirements.\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we focus on the on-chip realization of the DC-DC-LDO series connection, centering our analysis on the generation of a custom design of an efficient and compact PMIC core using the Skywater 130nm (SKY130) open-source CMOS technology.\n",

    "## PMIC core operating principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust power delivery systems must ensure stable voltages at specified load currents, incorporating sufficient regulation capabilities to enable the reliable operation of digital, analog, mixed-signal, and radio-frequency (RF) function blocks. In modern applications, the full integration of these solutions result in compact and low-cost systems with high efficiency and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, power management integrated circuits (PMICs) employ two types of regulators: DC-DC converters (also known as switching regulators) and low-dropout (LDO) linear regulators. Efficient switching DC-DC converters allow large input-output conversion ratios at the cost of large chip area and considerable output ripple, generating the need to use large passive components which are not compatible with integration in order to mitigate this effect. Placing these components off chip decreases the efficiency due to parasitic capacitances and power losses introduced by packaging, bonding and PCB traces. On the other hand, compact linear regulators can achieve low ripple at the expense of low efficiency, which degrades as the dropout voltage increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lately, heterogeneous integration approaches have been proposed with series and cascaded DC-DC and LDO blocks to generate multiple regulated voltage domains [2]. DC-DC circuits are placed close to the energy source to perform voltage conversion using large ratios. Complementary, LDOs are placed locally, close to the function blocks, to provide regulated voltage with a low dropout to enhance the efficiency of the power management system, allowing supply-sensitive circuits to operate correctly [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Design automation is a powerful tool which can help to decrease the design effort of complex integrated circuits in a myriad of scenarios. In the case of power circuits, a holistic analysis of efficiency and interference in a multi-channel regulated voltage network and a subsequent synthesis of the physical implementation based on a set of specifications can be of great help in the design of high-performance and low-power ASICs. This is the final aim of our current ongoing work."
