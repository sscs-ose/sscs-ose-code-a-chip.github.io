## IEEE SSCS Open-Source Ecosystem “Code-a-Chip” Travel Grant Awards at [VLSI'25](https://www.vlsisymposium.org)

**The IEEE SSCS Code-a-Chip Travel Grant Award** was created to:
 1. Promote *reproducible* chip design using *open-source* tools and *notebook-driven* design flows,
 2. Enable up-and-coming *talents* as well as seasoned *open-source enthusiasts* to travel to IEEE SSCS conferences and interact with the leading-edge chip design community, and
 3. Broaden *educational value* and accessibility within the open-source chip design community, fostering a more inclusive environment for dissemination, learning, and innovation.

## Program Rules

We run continuously the Code-a-Chip (CAC) competition for ISSCC and VLSI conferences with clear deadlines.

### Eligibility

- The program is open to anyone (no restrictions).
- IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS) membership is encouraged but not required.
- Teaming is encouraged, but each team must identify a single leader who can travel to **VLSI Symposium (Kyoto, Japan)**, June 08-12, 2025, to receive the award and participate in networking events. Therefore, at least one awardee must attend the conference in person to qualify for reimbursement.

### Submission Guidelines

- Applicants must submit an **open-source 📒 Jupyter notebook** detailing either one of the following categories, using **open-source** tools:
  1) *innovative circuit design* (Code-a-Chip)
  2) *creative approach for education* (Code-for-Chip)
- The objective is to disseminate the main ideas and design choices using **open-source tools and PDKs** in a **reproducible** manner.
  - Each submission must contain a suitable **open-source license** (e.g., Apache 2.0).
- Generating a final layout of your circuit is encouraged but not required.
- The creative approach of educational purposes of chip design may include and not limited to:
  - ex.1: innovative uses of Python packages for circuit visualization or generating animations to explain digital (e.g., D flip-flop) and analog (e.g., SAR ADCs) circuits,
  - ex.2: exploring open-source PDKs to explain Figure-of-Merit (FoM) of building blocks with SPICE simulation results that demonstrate the value of FoM (trend, foresight, etc).
- Examples:
  - [inverter](https://developers.google.com/silicon/guides/digital-inverter-openlane), [temperature sensor](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/docs/source/notebooks/temp-sense-gen/temp_sense_genCollab.ipynb)
- Winners of previous awards:
  - [ISSCC'25](ISSCC25/README.md), [ISSCC'24](ISSCC24/README.md), [ISSCC'23](ISSCC23/README.md), [VLSI'24](VLSI24/README.md), [VLSI'23](VLSI23/README.md)

## Evaluation
- A jury will evaluate the submissions and select up to 10 winners.

## Grant Amount
- Travel grants of up to US$500 (for secondary students), up to US$2,500 (for undergraduate students), and between US$1,000-US$5,000 (for graduate students and all others) will be awarded. This award can be used to reimburse travel and a portion of your accommodations until the dollar amount is used up.

## Program Logistics
- The notebooks must be submitted through a [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) at the [SSCS Open-Source Ecosystem Code-a-Chip](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-ose-code-a-chip.github.io) (OSE) GitHub portal.
    - Fork the source repo https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-ose-code-a-chip.github.io to your local repo.
    - Create a new directory `VLSI25/submitted_notebooks/<my_project_name>` in your local repo.
    - Add your Jupyter notebook to the directory.
    - Create a pull request from your local repo to the source repo.
- Notebooks submissions must follow guidelines in the **[How to Apply](howtoapply.md)** section.
- The winners are expected to attend the conference to be recognized for their awards and to present a poster.
- Reimbursement will be provided after the conference when air and accommodation receipts are sent to the conference Treasurer.
- Travel arrangements must comply with the [IEEE Travel and Expense Reimbursement Guidelines](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/travel-expense-reimbursement-guidelines.pdf).

## Program Schedule
- March 18, 2025, 8:00 AM Pacific Time: [Zoom meeting link TBD]()
- April 23, 2025, 11:59 AM Pacific Time: Notebook submission deadline (GitHub pull request)
- April 30, 2025: Announcement of [winners](VLSI25/README.md)
