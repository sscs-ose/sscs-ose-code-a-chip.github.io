## IEEE SSCS Open-Source Ecosystem “Code-a-Chip” Travel Grant Awards at ISSCC'23



**The International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) 2023 Code-a-Chip Travel Grant Award** is created to:
 1. Promote *reproducible* chip design using *open-source* tools and *notebook-driven* design flows and 
 2. Enable up-and-coming *talents* as well as seasoned *open-source enthusiasts* to travel to the Conference and interact with the leading-edge chip design community. 

This program is made possible by a donation from the [CHIPS Alliance](https://chipsalliance.org/), a non-profit organization hosted by The [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/).  
Notebooks submission must follow guidelines in the [How to Apply](/Notebooks/README.md) section.

## Program Rules
- The program is open to anyone (no restrictions). Membership in the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS) membership is encouraged, but not required. Teaming is encouraged, but each team must identify a single leader who can travel to the ISSCC from February 19-23, 2023, to receive the award.  
- Applicants must submit an **open-source Jupyter notebook** detailing an innovative circuit design using **open-source** tools 
    - examples: [inverter](https://developers.google.com/silicon/guides/digital-inverter-openlane), [temperature sensor](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/docs/source/notebooks/temp_sense_genCollab.ipynb)
- Each submission must contain a suitable **open-source license** (e.g., Apache 2.0).
- A jury will evaluate the submissions and award up to ~12 designs within two main categories:
    - *Category 1*: **Silicon-proven** designs. The technology used in the original design can be different from the one used in the notebook. The objective is to disseminate the main ideas and design choices using **open-source tools and PDKs** in a **reproducible** manner. The [temperature sensor](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/docs/source/notebooks/temp_sense_genCollab.ipynb) example falls into this category.
    - *Category 2*: A new idea that could be the basis for a future tapeout, with the same objectives regarding open **dissemination** and **reproducibility** as in Category 1.
- Travel grants of up to US$500 (for secondary students), up to US$2,500 (for undergraduate students), and between US$1,000-US$5,000 (for graduate students and all others) will be awarded. This award can reimburse travel and a portion of your accommodations until the dollar amount is used up. Complimentary registration for the conference itself will also be provided by ISSCC.
- Travel arrangements must comply with the [IEEE Travel and Expense Reimbursement Guidelines](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/travel-expense-reimbursement-guidelines.pdf) and awardees must attend the conference in person to qualify for reimbursement.
## Program Logisitcs
- The notebooks must be submitted through a [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) at the [SSCS Open-Source Ecosystem Code-a-Chip](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-ose-code-a-chip.github.io) (OSE) GitHub portal (Please check for further details and instructions).
- The winners are expected to attend the ISSCC’s Student-Research Preview session (Sunday evening) to be recognized for their awards, as well as an open source meetup event (details TBA).
- Reimbursement will be provided after the conference when air and accommodation receipts are sent to the ISSCC Treasurer.
