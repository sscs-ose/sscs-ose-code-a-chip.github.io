        "## Introduction\n",
        "ASCON is a family of authenticated encryption and hashing algorithms designed to be lightweight and easy to implement. It was recently accepted as a new lightweight crypto stadard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the [NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition (2019–2023)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography/finalists). It was also a finalist of the [CAESER Competition (2014-2019)](https://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar-submissions.html). The finalized standard for ASCON can be found [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/documents/finalist-round/updated-spec-doc/ascon-spec-final.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "## This Project\n",
        "Since ASCON is intended to be used for lightweight applications such as IOT the idea behind this project was to write a basic implementation of ASCON authenticated encryption and package it as a wishbone peripheral that could be included with something like a microcontroller or CPU core that uses a [wishbone bus](https://cdn.opencores.org/downloads/wbspec_b4.pdf). This was also a good opportunity for me to try out some open-source tools that I had not used before. Knowing that storage of large plaintexts/ciphertexts might be desirable for this implementation I decided to try out OpenRAM to generate a small RAM array for storage. A 1kb array is implemented here in the interest or reducing generation time, but the flexibility of this design would allow larger arrays given some configuration changes in the OpenRAM and OpenLane flows.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Design Overview\n",
        "This design is split into four main sections, the ASCON core itself, the wishbone interface, the memory block, and the data arbiters / memory controller for facilitating dataflow between the wishbone register file / RAM and the core. A high level diagram can be seen below.\n",
        "![top](https://github.com/zaellis/ASCON_code-a-chip/blob/main/imgs/wb_ASCON_top.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "### ASCON core\n",
        "ASCON operates off a fairly simple permutation structure reusing the same datapath components for each phase of encryption / decryption. The process for an ASCON encryption is shown in the image below ![ASCON_Process](https://github.com/zaellis/ASCON_code-a-chip/blob/main/imgs/ASCON_modes.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "$p^a$ and $p^b$ represent the permutation done a or b times respectively. The input / output of the permutation is known as the state and along with encrypted ciphertext / decrypted plaintext blocks, ASCON also ouputs a tag which is meant to uniquely identify the sequence of inputs in a way such that it would be unreasonably difficult to find another set of associated data / plaintext that produces the same tag. A basic diagram of the ASCON core is shown below.\n",
        "![ASCON_core](https://github.com/zaellis/ASCON_code-a-chip/blob/main/imgs/wb_ASCON_core.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation of the ASCON core is inspired by the template provided for the 2023 HOST microelectronics competition. The general structure and file naming conventions of that implementation have been retained, however with the exception of [ASCON_ROUND_FUNCTION.v](https://github.com/zaellis/ASCON_code-a-chip/blob/main/RTL/ASCON_ROUND_FUNCTION.v) and [ASCON_SBOX.v](https://github.com/zaellis/ASCON_code-a-chip/blob/main/RTL/ASCON_SBOX.v) all of the design files have been rewritten in SystemVerilog with entirely new code with some files such as [ASCON_CONTROLER.sv](https://github.com/zaellis/ASCON_code-a-chip/blob/main/RTL/ASCON_CONTROLER.sv) being rewritten in much fewer lines (~250 lines down from ~1200) while maintaining or exceeding the level of functionality. This version of ASCON is also parameterized to all an unroll of the round function. By setting the **UNROLL**, **A**, and **B** parameters accordingly, the controller will be adjusted to run in fewer cycles and the datapath will be replicated up to 6 times such that multiple rounds of the permutation will happen each clock cycle. With the configuration of RAM and the desire for acceptable area / flow completion time, these parameters will be kept at their standard values for this notebook.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Wishbone Interface\n",
        "This wishbone interface for this design, implemented in [wb_slave.sv](https://github.com/zaellis/ASCON_code-a-chip/blob/main/RTL/wb_slave.sv) is a standard pipelined wishbone slave with an 18 address 32 bit register file. For all addresses greater than 18 the wishbone bus is passed through to the memory controller which will read / write data from / to the RAM. In the case that the RAM is being accessed by the ASCON core, the transaction will not be successful and the wb_ack_o line will be held low. A description of the register file and it's contents can be found [here](https://github.com/zaellis/ASCON_code-a-chip/blob/main/imgs/ASCON_regs.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Memory Block\n",
        "The RAM block implemented here is a 1kb RAM with a 32 bit word size and 32 total words. it is a dual port RAM with no additional read / write granularity (reads / writes are always 32 bits). The full configuration can be found in config.py written below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Arbiters\n",
        "ASCON allows for associated data which is sent as plaintext but is run through the ASCON core during the encryption or decryption process. This allows a user to authenticate this data that is sent in plaintext form as the encryption / decryption process will not work correctly if this data is tampered with. The first data arbiter is [AD_loader](https://github.com/zaellis/ASCON_code-a-chip/blob/main/RTL/AD_loader.sv), which is in charge of loading the associated data from the register file to the ASCON core. AD_loader is timed with the ASCON core to present the input data at the write time while also letting the core know the data size. The user is able to program the size of the associated data by writing to the AD_len field of the control register (CR 0x00000004).\n",
        "\n",
        "The memory controller performs a similar function presenting the proper data and block size to the ascon core at exactly the right instance. It is also in charge of writing back the data output from the core back to memory. The memory controller will overwrite the plaintext stored in the RAM with the corresponding ciphertext block in order to make the most efficient use of space. Since the RAM has 32 bit words and ASCON uses 64 bit blocks, the memory controller needs to retrieve some data a clock cycle in advance so the full 64 bit output is valid at the write time. Similarly, the write back process from the ASCON core to the memory is a 2 cycle process. The reason for this choice was to reduce the size and complexity of the memory (the alternative option was a 64bit x 16 word memory with write select to allow read / write of either 64 or 32 bits at a time). The downside of this is that if the user wants to take advantage of the unroll parameters in the ASCON core, the memory will take too many cycles to fetch / write back data. Either the memory would have to be run at double the clock speed (which is a valid option in this case) or the more complex memory option would need to be used. "
